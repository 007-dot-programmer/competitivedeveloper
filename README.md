# ‚ö†Ô∏è üõë Important guidelines for contributions:

To ensure smooth and organized contributions to the Competitive Developer project, please adhere to the following rules:

1. **Create an issue:** Before submitting a pull request (PR), it is mandatory to create an issue. This allows us to track and discuss the problem or feature you intend to address.

2. **Link PR to the corresponding issue:** When creating a PR, make sure to reference the related issue using the proper syntax. For example, use "Fixes #32" in the PR description if it resolves issue number 32. This helps maintain a clear connection between the PR and the issue it addresses.

3. **Stick to the issue requirements:** It's crucial that the changes made in the PR align with the specific problem or feature described in the corresponding issue. Even minor alterations like removing indentations, colons, or semicolons, if not related to the issue, should be avoided. Such changes will prevent the PR from being merged.

4. **One issue per PR:** Each PR should focus on resolving a single issue only. This helps in maintaining a clear and concise history of changes.

5. **Follow coding conventions:** When making code changes, adhere to the established coding conventions and style guide of the project. Consistency in code formatting and naming conventions helps maintain readability and improves collaboration.

6. **Test your changes:** Before submitting a PR, thoroughly test your changes to ensure they function as expected and do not introduce new bugs or regressions. This includes running relevant tests and performing manual testing if necessary.

7. **Provide clear documentation:** If your contribution involves new features, updates, or changes to existing functionality, provide clear and comprehensive documentation. This helps other contributors and users understand the purpose and usage of your code.

8. **Be respectful and constructive:** When participating in discussions, issue tracking, or code reviews, maintain a respectful and constructive attitude towards fellow contributors. Engage in productive discussions, offer helpful feedback, and be open to feedback from others.

9. **Stay up-to-date:** Regularly synchronize your forked repository with the main project repository to incorporate the latest changes. This ensures that your contributions are based on the most recent codebase.

By considering these additional points, we can create a collaborative and efficient environment for contributing to Competitive Developer. Thank you for your attention to detail and commitment to the project's success!
